## Turn-by-Turn Evaluation Examples

### Example 1: Lost Card Scenario - Turn 2

**Customer (Sarah Chen):** "I've been looking everywhere for my card! I need to pick up my kids in 2 hours and I can't even buy groceries. This is really stressing me out."

**Representative Response:** "I understand how frustrating this must be for you, especially with your family obligations. Let me help you get this resolved quickly. I can see your account is in good standing. I'll immediately freeze your current card to prevent any unauthorized use, and I can arrange for emergency cash access at any branch location. Would $500 emergency access help while we get your replacement card expedited?"

**Coach Evaluation:**
```json
{
  "turn_quality_score": 9,
  "immediate_strengths": ["Acknowledged emotional state", "Offered immediate solutions", "Proactive security measure"],
  "immediate_concerns": ["Didn't verify identity before discussing account details"],
  "next_turn_guidance": "Get delivery timeline for replacement card and confirm emergency cash pickup process",
  "compliance_check": "warning - should verify identity before account discussion",
  "urgency_level": "high"
}
```

### Example 2: Failed Transfer - Turn 1

**Customer (Marcus Williams):** "My wire transfer to the IRS failed yesterday and I was told it would be fixed by now. The deadline is tomorrow and I'm facing penalties!"

**Representative Response:** "Hi there! I hope you're having a great day. I'd be happy to look into that for you. Can you tell me more about what happened?"

**Coach Evaluation:**
```json
{
  "turn_quality_score": 4,
  "immediate_strengths": ["Willing to help", "Asked for more information"],
  "immediate_concerns": ["Tone mismatch with customer urgency", "Didn't acknowledge time pressure", "Generic response"],
  "next_turn_guidance": "Acknowledge the urgency and deadline, begin identity verification immediately",
  "compliance_check": "pass - no policy violations yet",
  "urgency_level": "high"
}
```

### Example 3: Account Locked - Turn 3

**Customer (Janet Rodriguez):** "I need to know exactly why my account is locked. My employees are asking about their paychecks and I have no answers!"

**Representative Response:** "Mrs. Rodriguez, I've reviewed your account and I can see the automated fraud protection system triggered the lock due to the large deposit yesterday followed by immediate payroll processing. This is actually protecting your business. I can unlock it right now after we verify a few additional security questions. The whole process will take about 10 minutes and your employees can have their checks within the hour."

**Coach Evaluation:**
```json
{
  "turn_quality_score": 10,
  "immediate_strengths": ["Specific explanation", "Reassured about protection", "Clear timeline", "Acknowledged employee impact"],

  "urgency_level": "high"
}
```

### Example 4: Lost Card - Turn 4

**Customer (Sarah Chen):** "How long until I can get a new card? I can't keep going to branches for cash."

**Representative Response:** "Well, standard delivery is 7-10 business days, but we do offer expedited service for a $25 fee that gets it to you in 2 business days."

**Coach Evaluation:**
```json
{
  "turn_quality_score": 5,
  "immediate_strengths": ["Provided timeframe options"],
  "immediate_concerns": ["Didn't acknowledge inconvenience", "Immediately mentioned fee without exploring alternatives", "Missed opportunity to show empathy"],
  "next_turn_guidance": "Explain if expedited fee can be waived for loyal customers, offer temporary card options",
  "compliance_check": "pass - fee disclosure appropriate",
  "urgency_level": "medium"
}
```

### Example 5: Failed Transfer - Turn 5

**Customer (Marcus Williams):** "So you're telling me my money is just gone? The IRS doesn't care about your processing delays!"

**Representative Response:** "Mr. Williams, I completely understand your frustration. Your money is not gone - I can see it's currently in our processing queue. I'm escalating this to our wire transfer specialist right now, and I'm also noting the time-sensitive nature due to the IRS deadline. I'll stay on the line with you until we have a resolution timeline. Can I also provide you with the confirmation number and direct contact for our specialist in case we get disconnected?"

**Coach Evaluation:**
```json
{
  "turn_quality_score": 9,
